# Project to Create Android Applications for Beginners
Create a simple application using the Kotlin language that applies fundamental concepts from Android Studio such as ImageView, TextView, CardView, RecyclerView, etc. In this application there is a SplashScreen, main page, about page and share button.
The theme of the application that I made is about favorite songs where when each song item is pressed, will display details of the song's lyrics.
